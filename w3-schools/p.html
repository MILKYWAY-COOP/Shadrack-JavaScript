    <h2>HTML horizontal rules</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="a">&lt;hr&gt;</span> tag defines a thematic break in HTML
      page and is most often displayed as a horozontal rule. <br />
      The <span class="a">&lt;hr&gt;</span> tag is used to seperate contents in
      an HTML page.

    <h2>The poem problem</h2>
    <p>
      HTML ignore spaces added to any paragraph. And the poem will display on a
      single line. <br />
      Solution is the <span class="a">&lt;pre&gt;</span> element. <br />
      It defines performatted text, the text inside it is displayed in a
      fixed-width font and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

        Love is the thing that keeps you up all night because 
        
        you'd rather talk to that person than sleep.

        Love can be the best feeling in the world and also the worst.

        It can bring you higher than you've ever been, 

        build you, 

        complete you, make you. 

        Or it can tear you apart,

        completely destroy you,

        make you question everything you know, 

        keep you up at night and wonder where things went wrong. 

        Love is wanting someone else's happiness more than your own. 

        Love is sacrifice. It is respect and selflessness, forgiveness. 

        Love is the thing that makes the world worthwhile,

        makes your bed not seem lonely at night, 

        your days without them so much longer and your years with them so much shorter. 

        It is the thing that makes you look at that person 

        and think about how you've never seen something so perfect.
