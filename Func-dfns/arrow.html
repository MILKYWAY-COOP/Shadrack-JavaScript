    <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
    <p>
      They allow a short syntax for writing functions expressions. <br />
      You don't need the <span>function</span> keyword, and the
      <span>return</span> keyword and the <strong>carly brackets.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Arrow functions are not supported in IE11 or earlier.</p>

    <p>
      Arrow functions do not have their own <span>this</span>. <br />
      They are not well suited for defining <strong>object methods</strong>.
      <br />
      Arrow functions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are
      used. <br />
      Using <span>const</span> is safer than using <span>var</span>, because
      functions expression is always constant value. <br />
      You can only omit the <span>return</span> keyword and the
      <strong>carly brackets</strong> if the function is a single statement.
      <br />
      Because of this it might be a good habit to always keep them.
